# JetsProject

Welcome to Jets!

##Description 
Jets is an application in which starting the program a menu of options is displayed for the user to choose from. The menu has ten choices the user can make: 

* 1.  List fleet
* 2.  Fly all jets
* 3.  View fastest jet
* 4.  View jet with longest range
* 5.  Load all Cargo Jets
* 6.  Dogfight!
* 7.  Hunt Earthlings!
* 8.  Load Passengers
* 9.  Add a jet to Fleet
* 10. Remove a jet from Fleet
* 11. Quit

Once a selection is made the program will display the result of the selection and then loop back and display the menu again so another choice can be made. Included in the menu are three options specific to a type of aircraft. If an aircraft is capable it will then engage specific behavior related to its type. If a user decides to exit the program a selection of 10 will quit and display a goodbye message to the user in which the application ends and no more selections can be made.

##How to Run

## Lessons Learned 
This project really threw me for a loop and I learned a lot through the process. One thing I realized while working on this has been to keep it simple and not try and over-complicate my code across multiple classes. Once I realized this everything worked flawlessly and without error. Another valuable lesson that I learned is how imperative it is to not only review your code for errors but also the text file you are trying to read from. This could have saved me an entire day of searching for a typo that I assumed was within my buffered reader but was actually just an error in the text file I was reading from. As difficult as this project was I am thankful for its challenge as these learning experiences are ones that I hope to never forget.
